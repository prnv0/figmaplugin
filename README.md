## How it Works ?
In our plugin Colorus, there are two options. On clicking the "Random" button a random color palatte is genrated by mathematically altering the hsl values of a randomly generated hexcode. Alternatively you can input a custom hexcode and generate the adjacent color palattes. Once the palattes are generated the corresponding colors in the color palatte can be copied to the clipboard on a single click which can be used according to the need.
